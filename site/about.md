ChaosZone is the project to setting up an collaborative Assembly at the 35th
Chaos Communication Congress.

ChaosZone wants to become a place - a platform - to unite hackspaces around
C3D2, the Erfa of the Chaos Computer Club from Dresden in the former GDR.

We are  focused on hacking (software, hardware and other stuff). We are
providing a friendly environment for learning from each other.
