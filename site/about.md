ChaosZone is the project to setting up an collaborative Assembly at the 37th
Chaos Communication Congress.

ChaosZone wants to become a place - a platform - to unite hackspaces from
eastern germany and farther east

We are  focused on hacking (software, hardware and other stuff). We are
providing a friendly environment for learning from each other.
