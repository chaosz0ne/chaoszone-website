Today we are planning out things for the Assembly and hopefully also our Chaos
Competence Center. We will build a nice shelter to make the space comfy, we have
also some workshops in mind to be held at that location.

I am also pleased to announce, that we have subassemblies. These are:

- [Dezentrale][dz]
- [Chaostreff Chemnitz][chch]
- [CTJB][ctjb]
