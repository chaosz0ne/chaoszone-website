Hi there!

We are the ChaosZone, an assembly of hackers from eastern countries at the 34th
Chaos Communication Congress in Leipzig.

We aim to provide a comfy coding space with lots of collaboration, information
and knowledge sharing. There will surely be blinkenlights!

I am nek0, the main curator of this site and I will be also present at the
congress. I am looking forward to seeing all of you and wish you a pleasant time
until then.
