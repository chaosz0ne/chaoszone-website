## Join us on Matrix

Want to quickly ask a question about a project, share ideas, or just chat with fellow makers? Sometimes an email is too formal and finding someone in person isn't always possible.

That's why we use [Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)) - a modern, privacy-friendly, secure, and decentralized communication platform. Think of it as an open-source alternative to Slack or Discord, but without the vendor lock-in.

Matrix allows you to chat in real-time with our community, join different rooms for specific topics, and stay connected whether you're using your phone, computer, or web browser.

### Getting Started

The easiest way to join our Matrix channel is through the Element app, which works on all platforms:

**Option 1: Use it in your browser**  
Simply open [https://app.element.io/#/welcome](https://app.element.io/#/welcome) in your web browser.

**Option 2: Install the app**  
Download Element for your device from [https://element.io/get-started](https://element.io/get-started)

### Join Our Channel

Once you have Element running, you can join our main channel:
